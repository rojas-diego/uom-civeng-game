# Roadmap

## Planned

- [x] Display locations from a config file and a basic GUI.
- [x] Compute speed, cost and efficiency by running the student's `connect_locations` function.
- [x] Animate the student's algorithm by progressively running the pathfinding tests.

## Ideas

- [ ] Draw with harsher colors the paths that were taken most often.
- [ ] Give each location an icon instead of a color.
- [ ] Load a picture background of a city for each level to show water areas and other information.
